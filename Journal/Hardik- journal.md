- Design pattern COR was implemented by other team member

TRYING:

- Trying to add timer using in the game using Observer pattern
- Trying to toggle simple pane and advanced pane using Strategy pattern

I tried to add pattern to the code but couldn't implement, other then that I added journal and architecture. My try was to add timer to the FlowPane which is in the advanced mode using observer pattern when first event occurs on the board, the timer stops when new button(time to zero) is called by command or any of the player have won(displays time taken below with winner's name and again initializes to zero). I also wanted to implement Strategy pattern to toggle Simple Pane and Advanced Pane with a strategy interface which can be implemented by SimplePane Strategy and AdvancedPane Strategy where AdvancePane have same functionality as simplePane but in addition has Undo and Redo button

## XP core value

Every week, our team focused on one of the XP Core Values. This week, we focused on Respect. We discussed how it is important to treat each other with respect, even if we disagree. 
We also agreed to be mindful of the way we communicate with each other and to practice active listening. We also discussed the importance of respecting everyone in the team, regardless of their role. We discussed how we could continue to practice Respect throughout the project, such as by making sure everyone feels heard and respected in meetings, not interrupting when someone else is talking, and taking the time to really listen to others.
