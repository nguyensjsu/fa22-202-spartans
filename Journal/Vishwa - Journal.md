## Week 1
* Our team gathered up for the first time and initiated a SCRUM call and introduced ourselves and discussed on different gaming designs to see which one could better suit us.
* We had lots of thoughts darting around in your mind to pick the right topic to get started with the project which could fit enough design patterns.
* Explored multiple projects and tried to understand if it was possible to fit in the design patterns.

### Introduction - Tic-Tac-Toe
Traditional games have been born since thousands years ago, and the results of the ancient human culture are still condensed the values of the local wisdom. Traditional games are education tools used in the learning process of an individual, particularly children. However, games are important for children as they increase harmony between Mind (Thinking) and Muscles (Action) and enhance linguistic and mobility skills.

As it was a traditional game we thought of implementing some advance features that could be of great use when playing this game on a computer device.

## Week 2 - 3
As we thought of advance features previous week, we have implemented 3 buttons for this game.
    1. New Game button
    2. Undo Button
    3. Redo Button

In order to perform the necessary actions, **Command Pattern** was used to run the appropriate logic when the player clicks on any of the above buttons to perform the respective actions.

## Week 4
* Designed UML diagrams using Astah UML. 1.Use case diagram 2.State Diagram
* Although this could be done without state diagram - but it helps to show how to implement the state design pattern.
* Making of ad video was interesting as I had included some good animations and transitions.
